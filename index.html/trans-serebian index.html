 Siberian Way", the name "Trans-Siberian" was given to this route by the West, and that has since stuck. This railway is the backbone of Russia and perhaps the only overland route going through the whole country. Therefore it is still quite important for the economy as it was supposed to be more than 100 years ago.<br>.
It takes more than six days to travel along the whole Trans-Siberian route, so it is recommended to make stopoven along the way. After crossing Siberia (soon affer Irkutsk) the Trans-Siberian route divides into three different routes.
The Trans-Mongolian Route: Moscow-Ulan-Bataar-Beijing.
This is where my friends and I are heading to tomorrow from after stopover of Irkutsk and Ustivyanka. We will disembark and explore Ulsan Batar in Mongolia. Here are some pics of the Original rail track before the journey was bifurcated into a choice of three routes.
